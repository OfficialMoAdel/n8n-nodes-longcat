# Active Context: n8n-nodes-longcat

## Current Work Focus

The project has been updated to resolve a critical n8n workflow saving issue. The primary focus is now on maintaining code quality and addressing any outstanding technical debt from dependency warnings and security vulnerabilities.

## Recent Changes

- **Workflow Saving Fix**: Removed `displayOptions` from child parameters in the Options collection to resolve "Could not resolve parameter dependencies" error in n8n workflows
- **Dependency Installation**: Successfully ran `npm install` with 336 packages installed
- **Security Audit**: Identified 2 critical vulnerabilities in peer dependency `n8n-workflow` (related to `form-data` package)
- **Audit Fix Attempt**: Ran `npm audit fix` but vulnerabilities remain unfixed due to peer dependency constraints
- **Deprecated Dependencies**: Noted several deprecated dev dependencies (eslint@8.57.1, rimraf@3.0.2, glob@7.2.3, etc.)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

- **Security Review**: Assess whether the critical vulnerabilities in peer dependencies can be mitigated
- **Dependency Updates**: Evaluate updating deprecated dev dependencies to current versions
- **Build Verification**: Confirm the project builds and lints successfully
- **Testing**: Run existing tests to ensure functionality remains intact

### Medium-term Goals

- **Code Quality**: Address any linting issues or deprecated warnings
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure README and other docs reflect current capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Review API call efficiency and error handling
- **Feature Enhancement**: Consider additional AI agent integration features

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Dependency Management

- **Peer Dependencies**: `n8n-workflow: "*"` allows any version, but security vulnerabilities exist in current versions
- **Dev Dependencies**: Several packages are deprecated and should be updated carefully to avoid breaking changes
- **Security**: Critical vulnerabilities exist but may not be fixable at this level (peer dependency issue)

### Development Workflow

- **Build Process**: Uses TypeScript compilation with gulp for icon processing
- **Linting**: ESLint with n8n-specific rules, currently using deprecated ESLint v8
- **Testing**: Manual testing procedures documented, automated tests may need expansion

### AI Agent Integration

- **Tool Mode**: Implemented but may need refinement based on user feedback
- **Response Formats**: JSON and text outputs supported, structured metadata provided
- **MCP Compatibility**: Designed for Model Context Protocol integration

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Node Structure**: Single node implementation in `nodes/LongCat/` directory
- **Credentials**: Separate credential definition for API key management
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with n8n-workflow interfaces

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue-on-fail option for workflow robustness
- **Structured Errors**: Consistent error response format with timestamps
- **API Error Propagation**: Meaningful error messages from LongCat API

### API Integration

- **HTTP Requests**: Uses n8n's httpRequest helper for consistent behavior
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with API key
- **Parameter Mapping**: Direct mapping of n8n parameters to LongCat API fields

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

- **Peer Dependency Challenges**: Security vulnerabilities in peer dependencies cannot be resolved at package level
- **AI Agent Requirements**: Structured responses and metadata are crucial for AI agent compatibility
- **n8n Node Patterns**: Following established patterns ensures compatibility and discoverability

### User Experience Insights

- **Configuration Simplicity**: Visual parameter configuration reduces barrier to entry
- **Metadata Richness**: Comprehensive response metadata enables better workflow integration
- **Error Transparency**: Clear error reporting improves debugging and user confidence

### Development Insights

- **TypeScript Benefits**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors and improves maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns enables future feature additions
- **Documentation Importance**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation reduce support burden
